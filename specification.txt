1. Data Types
		
Integers and Array of Integers.

int data, array[100];
int sum;

All the variables have to be declared in the declblock{....} before being used
in the codeblock{...}. Multiple variables can be declared in the statement 
and each declaration statement ends with a semi-colon. 

In declaration block, no assignments are allowed like: "int a=1;". Just the variables are declared in this block.
They can't be declared in the main block.

	.....
}

4. if-else statement
